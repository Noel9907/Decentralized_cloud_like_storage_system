# Decentralized File Management System

## Description
The Decentralized File Management System project aims to provide a secure and decentralized way to manage files using blockchain technology. It allows users to upload files, create blockchain-based assets for each file, and retrieve files based on blockchain records.

## Features
- **File Upload:** Users can securely upload files through a user-friendly interface.
- **Asset Creation:** Each uploaded file generates a unique asset on the blockchain, associated with its IPFS address.
- **File Retrieval:** Users can retrieve uploaded files based on the blockchain records.

##Smart contract
It contains two fuctions
-One is create_asset which creates assets and returns the hash key
-The second is fetch_asset which feaches the assets using the hash key

## Installation
